Activities
a) In my workflow for adding references, I first collect citations directly from databases or journal websites using Zotero Connector. Once imported, I check the metadata fields such as author, title, year, publisher, and DOI against the original source to ensure accuracy. If some fields are missing or incorrect, I edit them manually in Zotero. For book chapters, I verify details like editors, publisher, and page numbers using library catalogues or Google Books. I also attach the PDF when available, so the reference and full text stay together. Finally, I organize references into collections by topic, which helps maintain both accuracy and accessibility.

b) Referencing software offers powerful features such as automatic citation generation, easy import from databases, and consistent formatting across different styles. It saves time, organizes sources efficiently, and links full texts with citation data. However, potential errors may occur if metadata is incomplete or inaccurate when importing, leading to missing authors, wrong page numbers, or incorrect formatting. Software may also misinterpret book chapters, conference papers, or web resources. Relying only on automation can produce mistakes if users don't double-check the details. Therefore, while referencing tools greatly improve efficiency, accuracy depends on carefully verifying and editing the imported records.
