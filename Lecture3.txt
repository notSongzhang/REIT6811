Activity 1: 

a. 
Newspaper article: Written for the general public; focuses on current events, concise reporting, and accessible language. It is less detailed and usually not peer-reviewed.
Blog post: Informal, often opinion-based or personal reflections. Can range from casual commentary to semi-professional analysis, but not subject to formal peer review.
Journal article: Scholarly, peer-reviewed research publication intended for academic audiences. Includes methodology, data, analysis, and citations. Uses formal, technical language.

b. 
Newspaper article: Likely to start with a hookâ€”a striking fact, event, or summary
Journal article: Likely to start with context or research framing

c. 
I may use newspaper articles as references because newspaper articles may provide real-world cases, statistics, or public responses that illustrate the urgency or societal impact. However there are limit reliance: They are not peer-reviewed and may lack depth, so they should supplement academic sources.

Activity 2:

a. 
Background and context of prior research; Key theories, models, or frameworks used; Strengths and weaknesses of previous work; Gaps or inconsistencies that justify new research; Evidence-based findings rather than opinions.

b. 
Data availability: Getting high-quality datasets of indoor environments to test different SLAM systems fairly.Evaluation metrics: Choosing consistent criteria such as accuracy, robustness, computational efficiency, and memory usage. Implementation complexity: Some SLAM systems may be harder to set up and require specific hardware or sensors. Reproducibility: Differences in datasets and robot platforms may make fair comparison difficult.

c. 
1.Many studies focus on single SLAM algorithms, but fewer provide direct comparative analyses across multiple systems under the same conditions.
2.Limited research exists on real-world indoor environments with dynamic changes
