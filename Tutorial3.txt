Tutorial journals
1. 
a.
   paper1: 10 citations
   paper2: 8 citations
   paper3: 0 citations
h-index=2

b.
The largest h such that h items(papers)each have >= citations.
For journals, it's all papers published by that journal, whereas for an author it's that author's publications.

c.
maximum h-index: 12 papers*10 years=120

d.
h-index=7. Because there are at least 7 papers with equal or more than 7 citations.

2.
a.
Computational Visual Media   JIF=17.3
Computer Science Review    JIF=13.3
COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM   JIF=11.1

b.
The JIF is a bibliometric indicator used to measure the average citation impact of articles published in a journal

c.
In google scholar,
Computational Visual Media h5-indices=33
Computer Science Review h5-indices=88
COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM h5-indices=74

d.
Web of Science tracks citations only from peer-reviewed journals and conferences, so its Impact Factors reflect a narrower, possibly more conservative count, typically leading to different ranking outcomes compared with Google Scholar.

3.
a.
There are 124 journals in this category.

b.
Choose quartile2 in JIF Quartile.

c.
IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING

4.
a.
FoR codes are used to classify research activities by discipline, providing a standard framework for reporting and evaluation. They are closely linked to funding because grant applications, research assessments, and government resource allocations are organised and compared according to FoR classifications.

b.
Graphics, augmented reality and games

c.
Cognitive and computational psychology: 5204

5.
a.
No, because CORE database focuses mainly on computing.

b.
A* and A:
IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality
ACM SIG International Conference on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques
IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces

6.
a.
h-index=249 in total, 212 since 2020

b.
Citations and h-index change continuously as new papers and citations accrue, so reporting the date makes your numbers reproducible and comparable.

c.
h-index in Scopus: 161

d.
h-index in Web of Science: 101

e.
Google Scholar is the broadest, so it usually yields higher citations and h-index. Scopus has wide journal + conference coverage but is curated; Web of Science Core Collection is the most selective. Coverage and disambiguation rules differ, so Bengio's metrics systematically vary across the three database.

f.
In cs, the h-index is supposed to increase by 1 each year. Prof.Bengio's h-index is supposed to be 34(1991-2025), but the actual value is far more than 34, which means he has great influence in computer science.
